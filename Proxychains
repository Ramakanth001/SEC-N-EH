[To Change your IP]
*Proxy vs proxychain:*
proxy server is intermediatory gateway between client and server.
Proxy chaining involves forwarding traffic from one proxy server to another

sudo apt install proxychains
locate proxychains
nano /etc/proxychains.conf

Un-Comment the type of proxy u want:
1.Random_chain [worst]
2.Dynammic_chain [Deafult]
3.strict_chain

Un-Comment 'proxy_DNS'
[This enables DNS updates using proxy. If DNS isnt updated, backtracking can be done with the dynammic IP and Location would be tracable]

Example:
PROTOCOL IP PORT ID PWD [Proxy Details]

under default proxy[socks4 IP Port],
add --> socks5 127.0.0.1 9050

write out

service tor status [To see status of proxy chain]
service tor stop
service tor start
proxychains firefox www.duckduckgo.com [proxychains web-browser website]
service tor stop
